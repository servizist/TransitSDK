SDK (Client + Domain Objects) for access and query to the SII TransitServer, which provides time-tables and real-time delay data for buses running in the South Tyrol region.

This SDK is for the version of TransitService currently in production; a new API is actively developed to make it mode general and useful, and to include more information.
